As a response to the ongoing hype and trend of JS stack all over the world, recently I thought to have a quick and refreshed overview of this awesome language. I am loving the way [ES6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) is taking Javascript to a great level by introducing awesome features in it. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is another reason I am focusing on this language lately to learn developing back-end and API centric application in a robust, scalable and asynchronous way. I love the concept of Event Driven, Single Threaded, Non-Blocking I/O based model that Node.js provides to the app developer.

So, last week I ended up writing a [Hand Crafted Note](https://nuhil.github.io/javascript-handbook/) of some major Javascript topics with examples taken from different sources, just to have a quick overview. I also put this note in a public GitHub repository and published it using GitHub pages (powered by Jekyll) for the readers and contributors. Check out the Handbook [Here](https://nuhil.github.io/javascript-handbook/) and feel free to fork and update the page by creating pull requests to the main repository. I always hope to learn from the community :)

Note: I will also share my high level (not the deep/detail) learning of Javascript in near future as an open source course for my native community under my initiative named [HowToCode.com.bd](https://www.howtocode.com.bd) on [This Link](https://js.howtocode.com.bd)

Have a great day!!! :)
